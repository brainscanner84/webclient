Guasa
=====

JavaScript WhatsApp client using [WhatsAPI](https://github.com/aesedepece/WhatsAPI).

## Setting up

 1. Clone or download a copy of aesedepece's [WhatsAPI](https://github.com/aesedepece/WhatsAPI) fork.
 2. Put it somewhere in a web server capable of running PHP. This doesn't need to be a public server, a localhost Apache or IIS works fine.
 3. Clone or download a copy of [Guasa](https://github.com/aesedepece/Guasa).
 5. (If you put it in the web server) access with your favourite browser (not MSIE, please) to the proper URL, i.e.: `http://localhost/Guasa/index.htm` or `http://example.com/Guasa/index.htm`.
 6. (If you put it wherever in a PC) just open `index.htm` with Mozilla Firefox (most browsers don't allow some HTML5 features to be runned locally but FF does).
 7. Fill in the login form. "WhatsAPI URL" is the URL for WhatsAPI server, i.e.: `http://localhost/WhatsAPI/server.php` or `http://example.com/WhatsAPI/server.php`.
 8. That's all. Enjoy!
